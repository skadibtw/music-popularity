# Music Popularity
A data‑driven look at why some songs become hits.

This is my pet-project, which I started to see correlation between song's popularity and its audio features. I'm planning to analyze through UK and US most popular songs for the last 50-60 years, when this goal is accomplished i'd try to collect a dataset with most popular Russian songs.

## RoadMap:
- Clean datasets
- Train a neural network to get audio features(RIP Spotify API)
- Analyze the data i got
- Upload a video on youtube about my research(MAYBE??)


## Quick start
